            </header>
            <p>As we step into our final year, I wanted to take a moment to celebrate not just your special day, but
                also the journey we've shared through college. From those early first-year moments to now, it's been a
                wild and memorable ride, and I'm truly glad to have experienced so many of those moments with you.
                Looking back while putting this little something together reminded me of just how far we've come. You've
                been a wonderful part of my college life â€” a kind, smart, and genuine person whose presence has always
                made things brighter âœ¨.</p>
            <p>You truly deserve a birthday that's as amazing as you are ðŸŒŸ and a year filled with new adventures,
                happiness, and success ðŸŽˆ. It's been inspiring to see the person you are and the path you're paving for
                yourself, and I have no doubt you'll do incredible things in the future. So here's to you â€” a beautiful
                soul I've had the chance to know â€” may today be filled with joy, and may the year ahead bring everything
                you hope for and more. </p>
            <p>Hope you have a great day today and everydayâœ¨!</p>
